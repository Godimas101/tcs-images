# 🖼️ TCS Images - The Digital Gallery

> **"A picture is worth a thousand tokens."** — An AI, probably

## What's This?

The official image repository for **The Canadian Space** projects. Store once, reference everywhere. Think of it as our own personal CDN, minus the bills.

## What Lives Here? 📸

### Current Content

- 📱 **Social Media Graphics** - Images for posts, banners, and promotional content across platforms
- 📚 **Monthly Deep-Dives** - Visual assets for in-depth monthly articles and features

## Why a Separate Repo?

Because storing images in code repos is like storing milk in a toolbox — technically possible, but why?
The real question is why not!??!

**Benefits:**
- 🔗 **Direct linking** via GitHub raw URLs
- 📦 **Keeps other repos light** (nobody likes bloat)
- 🔄 **Version control for assets** (yes, even images have history)
- 🎯 **Centralized asset management** (one place to rule them all)
- 💪 **No flaky free image hosting** (reliable, always available, no ads)

## Usage

### Linking Images

```markdown
![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Godimas101/tcs-images/main/path/to/image.png)
```

### Organization

Current structure (expanding as The Canadian Space grows):

```
tcs-images/
├── social-media/       # Content for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
└── monthly-deep-dives/ # Visual assets for monthly feature articles
```

## Rules of the Road

1. **Use descriptive names**: `spacex-launch-2026-02.png` > `image123.png`
2. **Organize by project/type**: Future you will thank you
3. **Optimize before upload**: Nobody likes 50MB screenshots
4. **Credit sources**: If it's not ours, say where it came from

## Supported Formats

- 🖼️ PNG (for graphics with transparency)
- 📷 JPG (for photos and screenshots)
- 🎨 SVG (for logos and vectors)
- 🎬 GIF (for when static just won't do)

## Fun Facts

- Images are forever (on the internet)
- Every pixel tells a story
- This README is technically an image description
- We believe in the Oxford comma
